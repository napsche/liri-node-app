# liri-node-app

Using the liri-node-app should allow the user to spotify-this-song in the node terminal and extract useful data about that track. 

By inputing the track name, the Spotify API will return the Artist, Track Name, Album, and a link to preview the track. 

The .env file contains the user (my own) Spotify ID and Spotify Secret identifier; these are provided after signing up for an account. These identifiers are unique to my account and allow Spotify to provide the requested data. 

The required JSON packages are stored in the package.json file. 

.gitignore excludes unneccesary information from being displayed. 

keys.js file contains the exported spotify information that can be referenced from any file within this folder.
